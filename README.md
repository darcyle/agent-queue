# Agent Queue

**Put your AI agents to work. Go touch grass.**

Agent Queue is a task queue and orchestrator for AI coding agents (primarily Claude Code) on throttled/subsidized plans. It keeps agents busy across your projects, handles rate limits automatically, and queues the next task before the current one finishes. Manage everything from Discord on your phone — queue up tasks, come back to completed PRs.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, a [Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications), Claude Code installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElectricJack/agent-queue.git
cd agent-queue
./setup.sh
```

The setup script handles dependencies, Discord config, API keys, and first agent creation.

Once running, talk to the bot in your Discord channel:

```
You:  link ~/code/my-app as my-app
You:  create a project called my-app
You:  create agent claude-1 and assign it to my-app
You:  add a task to add rate limiting to the API
```
