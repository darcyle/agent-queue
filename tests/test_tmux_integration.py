"""TmuxProvider against a real tmux server (Linux CI only).

Everything runs on an isolated per-test socket so a developer's own tmux
server (and the daemon's ``aq`` socket) is never touched.  The stub agent
is a tiny raw-mode REPL that behaves like a harness TUI: optional startup
dialog, a ``❯`` prompt with a trailing NBSP (exactly what Claude paints),
and every submitted line appended to ``received.txt`` so delivery is
asserted on disk, not by scraping the screen.

Spec: docs/specs/implementation/session-runtime.md §8 (test_tmux_integration
row) and the §9 pitfall table.

#: which is exactly why real TUIs run raw), strips bracketed-paste markers,
#: appends each submitted line to received.txt, and repaints the prompt.

#: ``--eat-file=<path>`` reproduces the lost-Enter stall: while that file
#: reads ``eat``, every submit is swallowed and the typed text stays on the
