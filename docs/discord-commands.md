# Discord Commands

Agent Queue gives you two ways to interact through Discord:

| Method | How it works | Best for |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Slash commands** | Type `/` and pick from the autocomplete menu | Structured operations with clear parameters |
| **Natural language chat** | Just type a message in the bot's channel | Quick requests, complex descriptions, multi-step workflows |

Both methods call the same underlying logic — slash commands are just a structured shortcut for what you can always ask the chat agent to do in plain English.

**Example — creating a task both ways:**

```
Slash:  /add-task description: Fix the login timeout bug in auth.py

Chat:   hey, can you add a task to fix the login timeout bug in auth.py?
        the error is on line 47, JWT expires too early
```

The chat approach lets you include richer context naturally.

## Getting Oriented

These commands give you a quick picture of what's happening across your system.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | System overview — active/ready/completed task counts, agent states, queued work |
| `/projects` | List all projects with their status, credit weight, and linked channels |
| `/agents` | List all agents and what they're currently working on |
| `/usage` | Show Claude Code usage — active sessions, tokens, rate limits |
| `/events` | Recent system events (task completions, failures, etc.) |
| `/menu` | Show an interactive control panel with clickable buttons |

### `/status`

Shows a dashboard-style overview: task counts by state, each agent's current assignment, and the next tasks in queue. This is usually the first command you run.

### `/events`

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `limit` | No | Number of events to show (default: 10) |

### `/menu`

Opens an interactive embed with buttons for common operations — a quick way to navigate without remembering command names.

| `/delete-project` | Delete a project and all its data |
| `/set-default-branch` | Set the default branch for a project (creates it if needed) |

#### `/new-project`

Opens an interactive wizard modal to walk you through project creation. No parameters needed — everything is configured through the wizard UI.

#### `/edit-project`

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `project_id` | Yes | Project ID |
| `name` | No | New name |
| `credit_weight` | No | New scheduling weight |
| `max_concurrent_agents` | No | New max agents |
| `budget_limit` | No | Token budget limit (0 to clear) |
| `channel` | No | Discord channel to link to this project |

#### `/delete-project`

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `project_id` | Yes | Project ID to delete |
| `archive_channels` | No | Archive the project's Discord channels instead of leaving them |

Deletion removes all associated tasks, workspaces, results, and token records. Cannot delete a project with tasks currently in progress.

When an active project is set, commands that need a project will default to it. Leave `project_id` empty to clear.

Each project can have a dedicated Discord channel. Commands run in that channel automatically target the right project — no need to specify `project_id` every time.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/create-channel` | Create a new Discord channel and link it to a project |
| `/channel-map` | Show all project-to-channel mappings |

#### `/create-channel`

| Parameter | Required | Description |

## Working with Tasks

### Creating tasks

#### `/add-task`

The quickest way to create a task from Discord.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | Yes | What the task should do |

The project is auto-detected from the channel, or falls back to the active project. Returns an error if no project can be resolved.

**Via chat** — you can provide much richer context:

```
Create a task for my-app to refactor the database connection pooling.
Currently it creates a new connection per request which is causing
timeouts under load. Use SQLAlchemy's built-in pool with max 20
connections. The relevant code is in src/db/connection.py.
```

For tasks in AWAITING_APPROVAL status — marks them as COMPLETED so downstream dependents can proceed.

#### `/skip-task`

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `task_id` | Yes | Task ID |

Marks a BLOCKED or FAILED task as COMPLETED without actually doing the work. Use this to unblock dependency chains when a task is no longer needed. Shows how many downstream tasks were unblocked.

### Task Archiving

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|

#### `/restore-task`

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `task_id` | Yes | Archived task ID to restore |

### Task Dependencies

Dependencies control execution order — a task in DEFINED state won't promote to READY until all its dependencies are COMPLETED. The orchestrator checks dependencies every cycle (~5 seconds).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/chain-health` | Diagnose stuck dependency chains |
| `/task-deps` | Show what a task depends on and what depends on it |
| `/skip-task` | Skip a blocked task to unblock its dependents |

#### Dependency workflow: skip to unblock

When a task in a dependency chain fails or gets blocked, all downstream tasks stay stuck in DEFINED. You have two options:

1. **Fix and retry** — Use `/restart-task` to re-queue the blocked task
2. **Skip and unblock** — Use `/skip-task` to mark it COMPLETED without doing the work, which unblocks all downstream dependents

The `/chain-health` command helps you diagnose these situations by showing which blocked or failed task is holding up the chain and how many downstream tasks are affected.

```
Example workflow:
  task-A (BLOCKED) → task-B (DEFINED) → task-C (DEFINED)

  /skip-task task_id: task-A
  ✓ Skipped task-A. 1 downstream task unblocked.

  Next cycle: task-B promotes to READY → gets assigned → starts working
  When task-B completes: task-C promotes to READY
```

## Tips & Tricks

**Channel context saves typing.** Run commands from a project's dedicated channel and you won't need to specify `project_id` on every command. Use `/channel-map` to see which channels are linked.

**Task IDs are human-readable.** Tasks get names like `bold-falcon` or `quiet-owl` — easy to remember and type. Use them with any task command.

**Dependency chains.** When an agent produces a plan file, the orchestrator automatically creates chained subtasks with dependencies. Use `/chain-health` to diagnose stuck chains and `/skip-task` to unblock them.

**Just ask.** If you're not sure which command to use, just describe what you want in plain English. The chat agent has access to all the same operations as slash commands, plus file reading, shell commands, and more.

**Git command aliases.** Many git commands have multiple names: `/commit` and `/project-commit` and `/git-commit` all do the same thing. Use whichever feels natural.

**Task archiving.** Use `/archive-tasks` to clean up completed tasks and keep your task list focused. Archived tasks are preserved in markdown notes and can be restored with `/restore-task`.

**Interactive controls.** Use `/menu` for a button-based control panel, or `/browse` to navigate files with clickable dropdowns instead of typing paths.
