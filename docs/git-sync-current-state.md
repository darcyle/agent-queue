# Git Sync for Agent Workspaces — Current State

**Source files:** `src/git/manager.py`, `src/orchestrator.py`

This document captures what the current git sync workflow does well, identifies
the design decisions already in place, and serves as a baseline for future
improvements to multi-agent workspace synchronization.

## What Works Well Today

### 1. Workspace Isolation

Each `(agent, project)` pair gets its own cloned directory, stored at
`{workspace_dir}/{project_id}/{agent.name}/{repo_name}`. This is cached in the
`agent_workspaces` SQLite table so the mapping is stable across restarts.

**Why it matters:** Two agents working on the same project never touch the same
working tree, eliminating an entire class of filesystem-level conflicts (dirty
index, mixed staged changes, etc.).

Three source types are handled cleanly:

| Source type | Workspace strategy |
|---|---|
| **CLONE** | Per-agent clone in workspace dir |
| **LINK** | Shared local path (all agents see the same directory) |
| **INIT** | Per-agent new repo in workspace dir |

### 2. Branch-per-Task Model

Every task gets a unique branch named `<task-id>/<slugified-title>`
(e.g. `brave-fox/add-retry-logic`). The task ID prefix makes branches trivially
traceable back to their originating task, and the slug provides human context.

**Why it matters:** Agents' work is isolated at the git level, not just the
filesystem level. Concurrent agents can work on different branches in their own
clones without interfering with each other.

### 3. Pre-Task Fetch and Pull

`prepare_for_task()` always runs `git fetch origin` before creating the task
branch, ensuring the agent starts from the latest known state of the remote.
For normal clones, it also does `git pull origin <default_branch>` to
fast-forward the local default branch.

**Worktree-aware branching:** When the checkout is a git worktree (detected via
`_is_worktree()`), the code correctly avoids checking out the default branch
locally (which would conflict with the main working tree) and instead creates
the task branch directly from `origin/<default_branch>`.

**Why it matters:** Agents start each task from a reasonably fresh base,
reducing the chance that their work diverges too far from the remote.

### 4. Graceful Error Suppression

Git operations that may legitimately fail (no remote configured, no upstream
tracking branch, network errors during fetch) are wrapped in `try/except
GitError: pass` blocks. This allows LINK repos with no remote and newly-init'd
repos to go through the same code paths as fully-configured CLONE repos.

The outer `_prepare_workspace()` method wraps *all* git operations in a
catch-all that logs a warning but still returns the correct workspace path.
The agent can always start work even if branch setup fails.

**Why it matters:** The system degrades gracefully rather than failing
catastrophically when git operations don't succeed.

### 5. Post-Completion Commit

`_complete_workspace()` always commits agent work using `commit_all()`, which:

1. Runs `git add -A` to stage everything (including untracked files the agent
   created).
2. Checks `git diff --cached --quiet` to detect whether anything is staged.
3. Only creates a commit if there are actual changes.

The add-then-check pattern avoids the race condition of checking working-tree
status before staging.

**Why it matters:** Agent work is never silently lost — every modification is
captured in a commit before any merge/push/PR logic runs.

### 6. Plan Subtask Branch Accumulation

When a plan generates multiple subtasks, they all share the parent task's
branch name. Subtasks use `switch_to_branch()` (which fetches and pulls) rather
than `prepare_for_task()` (which would create a new branch off default). This
lets sequential subtasks accumulate commits on a single branch.

Only the *final* subtask in a chain triggers the merge-or-PR decision, and it
inherits the parent's `requires_approval` flag.

**Why it matters:** A multi-step plan produces a single coherent branch with
all changes, rather than N separate branches that would each need independent
review.

### 7. Dual Completion Paths (PR vs Direct Merge)

The system cleanly supports both:

- **Tasks requiring approval** → push branch + create PR via `gh pr create`.
  Task moves to `AWAITING_APPROVAL`. The orchestrator polls PR status every
  60 seconds via `gh pr view --json state,mergedAt`.
- **Tasks without approval** → merge branch into default + push (CLONE repos)
  or merge locally only (LINK repos).

Both paths include error handling with user-facing notifications on failure.

**Why it matters:** Teams that want human review before code lands can use the
PR path; solo developers or trusted automation can use direct merge.

### 8. Merge Conflict Detection

`merge_branch()` attempts the merge and, on failure, runs `git merge --abort`
to restore the working tree. The orchestrator notifies the user with a clear
message identifying the conflicting task and branch.

**Why it matters:** A failed merge never leaves the working tree in a broken
state, and the user is told exactly which branch needs manual resolution.

### 9. Branch Cleanup

After a successful merge or PR completion, the system attempts to delete the
task branch both locally (`git branch -D`) and remotely
(`git push origin --delete`). This is best-effort — failures are silently
ignored.

**Why it matters:** Prevents branch proliferation without risking errors if
the branch was already cleaned up (e.g. by GitHub's "delete branch after merge"
setting).

### 10. Task Retry Resilience

Both `prepare_for_task()` and `switch_to_branch()` handle the case where the
task branch already exists (e.g. after a crash or restart mid-task). Instead of
failing, they switch to the existing branch so work can resume.

**Why it matters:** The system survives restarts and retries without requiring
manual cleanup of stale branches.

### 11. Approval Polling with Escalation

The `_check_awaiting_approval()` loop handles edge cases thoughtfully:

- **PR-backed tasks:** Polls merge status; transitions to COMPLETED on merge
  or BLOCKED on close-without-merge (with downstream chain notifications).
- **Tasks without a PR URL that don't require approval:** Auto-completes after
  a grace period (handles intermediate subtasks that end up in
  AWAITING_APPROVAL without actually needing review).
- **Tasks without a PR URL that do require approval:** Sends periodic reminders
  (hourly) and escalates after 24 hours to prevent tasks from rotting silently.

**Why it matters:** No task gets permanently stuck in AWAITING_APPROVAL without
the user being notified.
