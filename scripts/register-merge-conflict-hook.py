"""Register the merge-conflict-detection hook for a project.

Usage:
    python scripts/register-merge-conflict-hook.py <project_id> <repo_workspace_path>

Example:
    python scripts/register-merge-conflict-hook.py agent-queue /home/jkern/agent-queue-workspaces/agent-queue

This creates a periodic hook that:
1. Runs check-merge-conflicts.sh against the project repository
2. If conflicts are found, asks the LLM to create resolution tasks
3. Runs every 30 minutes with a 30-minute cooldown

A periodic check has detected merge conflicts between task branches and the main branch.

## Conflict Report
```json
{{{{step_0}}}}
```

## Your Instructions

For EACH branch with a conflict:

1. **Create a resolution task** using the `create_task` tool with:
   - `project_id`: "{project_id}"
   - `title`: "Resolve merge conflict: <branch_name>"
   - `description`: Include the following details:
     - Branch name
     - Task ID (extracted from the branch name, which follows the pattern `task-id/description`)
     - Which files have conflicts
     - How many commits behind main the branch is
     - Instructions: "Rebase the branch onto main and resolve all merge conflicts. Ensure all tests pass after resolution."
   - `task_type`: "chore"
   - `priority`: 50 (higher priority since conflicts block merging)

2. **Post a notification** to the project's Discord channel mentioning:
   - How many branches have conflicts
   - Which branches are affected
   - That resolution tasks have been created

Be concise. Only create tasks for branches that actually have conflicts.
If a conflict resolution task likely already exists for a branch (based on the task ID), mention that in your response but still create the task — duplicates can be handled manually.
