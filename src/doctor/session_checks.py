"""``sessions.*`` doctor checks (session-runtime).

Shape mirrors ``src/doctor/pool_checks.py``: a private ``_find_*`` /
``_check_*`` / ``_fix_*`` trio plus a factory returning the list of
:class:`DoctorCheck`.

sessions.stuck_composer — the rule
----------------------------------

A nudge is *typed* into the harness's composer and then submitted with
Enter.  Enter races the composer's repaint, and when it loses, the text
stays in the input line.  That is not a self-healing state: the next nudge
runs ``TmuxProvider._require_empty_composer``, refuses to type into a
non-empty composer, and defers — forever.  The stall ladder stops climbing
and the message is never seen, which is precisely what a single manual
``tmux send-keys Enter`` fixes in a second.

The provider remembers the marker of any nudge it typed and could not
confirm, so this check is a read of provider state plus one screen capture
per suspect session — never a scan of every pane.  A session is reported
only while the composer *still* shows that marker on its input line; an
agent that submitted or deleted the text in the meantime clears the record
and reports OK.

``--fix`` presses Enter, gated on the same marker match.  That is the same
key the operator would send by hand, and it can only ever submit text this
daemon typed: a human draft never carries the marker, so it is never
touched.
