"""Shared type aliases for the messaging abstraction layer.

These callback signatures define how the orchestrator communicates with
whichever messaging transport is active.  They were previously defined
inline in ``src/orchestrator.py`` — now they live here so both the
orchestrator and the transport implementations share the same types.
