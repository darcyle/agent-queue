"""Brush system for the voxel level editor.

Handles 2D brush shapes (square, circle) with correct z-depth placement
based on raycasting when fill_all_depths is disabled.

Key behavior:
- When fill_all_depths=True: brush fills all z-depths in the grid
- When fill_all_depths=False: brush raycasts from the camera direction to find
  the first intersected voxel, then places new voxels IN FRONT of that surface.
  If no voxel is hit, falls back to the back-most plane (z=0).
