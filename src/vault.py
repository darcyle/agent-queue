"""Vault directory structure initialization.

Creates the ``~/.agent-queue/vault/`` directory tree described in
``docs/specs/design/vault.md`` §2.  The vault is a structured, human-readable
knowledge base (Obsidian-compatible) that serves as the single source of truth
for system configuration and accumulated intelligence.

The top-level structure is created once at orchestrator startup via
``ensure_vault_structure()``.  Per-profile and per-project subdirectories are
created dynamically as profiles and projects are added.

All directory creation is idempotent — calling any function when the directories
already exist is a safe no-op.
