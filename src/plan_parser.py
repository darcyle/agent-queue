"""Plan file discovery and reading utilities.

When an agent completes a task that results in an implementation plan
(written to ``.claude/plan.md`` or a similar file in the workspace), this
module provides utilities to find and read plan files.

Plan *parsing* (breaking a plan into subtasks) is handled exclusively by
``Supervisor.break_plan_into_tasks()`` which uses LLM tool calls to
create tasks directly.
