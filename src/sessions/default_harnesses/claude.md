# Claude Code

The default harness. Runs the `claude` CLI as a **full interactive TUI** —
never `claude -p` print mode — so a human can attach to the session and read
it, and so the daemon observes progress rather than blocking on a stream.

Edit this file to change how Claude is launched. It is read live by the
vault watcher; no restart, no release.

## Notes

**`ready_prompt_prefix` is a non-breaking space.** Claude's prompt is
`❯` + U+00A0, not `❯` + U+0020. The readiness poll normalizes NBSP before
matching, so either spelling in this file works — but if you retype the
line, do not "fix" the character.

**`permission_flag` is permission to use the flag, not a promise to.**
It relies on the trust argument in [[design/trust-and-ops]] §4: the agent
runs inside a disposable worktree with a scrubbed environment, so skipping
in-session permission prompts trades a prompt no human is present to answer
for a blast radius that is already bounded. That argument only holds where
the premise does, so `SessionSpecBuilder` emits the flag **only** when the
session's `work_dir` is an isolated git worktree
(`RepoSourceType.WORKTREE`) or the profile explicitly sets
`permission_mode: bypassPermissions`. In a `link`ed checkout of the
operator's real repo it is withheld. Remove the flag from this file to get
interactive permission prompts back everywhere — the session is attachable,
so a human *can* answer them.

**`settings_flag`** is what makes `hook_files` live. The hook JSON is
written into the work_dir, and `--settings .aq/hooks/claude.json` is what
tells the CLI to read it; without the flag the file is inert and
`supports_hooks: true` is a lie.

**`skip_escape_before_enter: true`** — Claude submits cleanly on Enter. Some
harnesses need an Escape first to leave a mode; grok's Escape *clears* the
input, and codex's double-Escape backtracks, which is why this is per-harness
data and not a blind key sequence in provider code.

**`composer_clear_keys: ["C-u"]`** is the recovery key for a nudge that was
typed but never submitted. Enter races the composer's repaint (an attached
dashboard terminal resizing the pane is the reliable way to lose one), and
text left behind blocks every later nudge on the empty-composer guard — the
stall ladder then stops climbing forever. The provider first re-presses
Enter on a widening backoff; only if that still fails does it clear with
these keys, and only while it can still see its own marker on the input
line. Empty this list to make the provider leave the text alone instead.

**Dialogs share one budget** (`sessions.dialog_budget_seconds`, default 8 s)
across the whole table, not 8 s each. Nine per-dialog budgets is how the
Gas City runtime blew its start deadline.

**`SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` are wired** to `aq subagent event
--hook-json`, which is where native sub-agent counts come from. Claude
sends `agent_id` on both halves (plus `agent_type`, and
`agent_transcript_path` on Stop), so a child's start pairs exactly with
its stop and a duplicate delivery collapses onto the row it already wrote.
The receiver never blocks the session: `aq subagent event` exits 0 even
when the daemon is unreachable, because a missed count must not stop a
sub-agent from starting.

**The trust screen is painted late, and its rows start with `❯`.** The
highlighted row of the trust dialog is `❯ No, exit` — the readiness poll's
own prefix — so readiness is only believed on a capture where *no* rule in
this table matches, and the last dismissal pass holds its "quiet" verdict
open for `sessions.dialog_settle_seconds` (default 1.5 s) before startup
finishes. Without both, a pool session was recorded running while its pane
still sat on the trust screen (task smart-orbit.7).

**No Stop hook.** Completion is explicit — `aq task close …` then
`aq session drain-ack`. A Stop hook would re-introduce exit-as-success,
which is the failure this whole runtime exists to remove.

**`SessionStart` matches `resume|compact` only.** Fresh starts already
receive the bootstrap prompt through argv (see `SessionSpecBuilder`); a
SessionStart hook that also ran `aq prime --hook-json` on startup would
double-inject. The hook is active exactly where the argv prompt is
absent: resuming a session and returning from a PreCompact.

**There is no `UserPromptSubmit` hook** (removed 2026-08-27). It ran
`aq inbox --inject` at every prompt boundary, which cost ~1.3 s of Python
interpreter startup per prompt for a delivery path the cascade's nudge
already covers.

(The 2026-08-27 note here also claimed `aq inbox` delivered nothing
because it was a Phase S1 stub. That was wrong: two modules registered
`aq inbox` on the click root group and `src/cli/messages.py`'s real
command won in the normal import order — the stub only won in a process
that imported `src.cli.agent_surface` first. The stub has since been
deleted, so `aq inbox` is unambiguously the real `messages.py` command.)

Nothing is lost. A message queued while the session is mid-turn is
delivered by the cascade's nudge as soon as the session goes idle — which
is the same moment a prompt boundary would have arrived — with the
transcript-tail fallback behind it and prime injection at session start.
Prompt-boundary injection is an *optimization* over those paths and has to
be measured against them before it comes back, rather than being assumed.
This is the per-turn shell-out the 2026-08-19 Gas City comparison listed
among their weaknesses; we had adopted the mechanism without answering the
criticism.
