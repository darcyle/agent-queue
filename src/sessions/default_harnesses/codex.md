# OpenAI Codex

Runs the `codex` CLI as a full interactive TUI (same rationale as the
claude harness: attachable, observable, never a blocking print mode).

Edit this file to change how Codex is launched. It is read live by the
vault watcher; no restart, no release.

## Notes

**Use a current Codex CLI.** Intelligence classes select `gpt-5.6-luna` for
fast work, `gpt-5.6-terra` for standard work, and `gpt-5.6-sol` for deep work.
Their Off and Low levels both use Codex's lowest supported reasoning level,
`low`; Medium and High use the corresponding levels. Generic OpenAI API
mappings remain separate. All three models were verified with Codex **0.151.0**
using ChatGPT login. The older **0.125.0** CLI was tested only with Luna; it
rejected that model and requested a newer CLI. These are versions tested,
not an exact minimum version.

**`ready_prompt_prefix` is `›` (U+203A) + a plain space** — verified by
launching codex 0.125.0 under tmux and capturing the pane bytes
(`E2 80 BA 20`). This is a different character from Claude's `❯` (U+276F).

**`resume.style` is `none`, deliberately.** Codex chooses its own session
UUID and offers no way to pin it at launch (no `--session-id` analogue),
so the daemon's session UUID means nothing to `codex resume` — declaring
`subcommand` resume made relaunches die with "No saved session found with
ID <daemon-uuid>" (observed live, 2026-08-21). The CLI itself supports
`codex resume <uuid>` / `codex fork`.

**The blocker is now gone**: the transcript reader learns the real UUID off
disk and `TranscriptWatcher._learn_session_key` writes it to
`sessions.session_key` on the first poll, so a restart *does* have a key to
resume from. Flipping this to
`{"style": "subcommand", "subcommand": "resume", "supports_fork": true}`
needs one thing verified first — that a session killed mid-turn resumes
cleanly from a rollout written by the previous process — so it is left as a
deliberate next step rather than flipped untested. Until then restarts
start fresh.

**`supports_hooks: true` — discovery, not a flag** (verified live against
codex-cli 0.151.0 on 2026-09-01). Codex has no settings-file flag like
Claude's `--settings`; it discovers hooks from `~/.codex/hooks.json` and
`<cwd>/.codex/hooks.json`. `SessionSpecBuilder` therefore writes the
project-level file into the session's work_dir and passes no flag for it —
which is why `_compose_argv`'s "a written-but-unpointed hook file is a lie"
rule has a second branch (`hook_trust_flag`) rather than one.

**`hook_trust_flag` is load-bearing.** A discovered hook file does *not*
run until it has been trusted: Codex persists a per-file
`{enabled, trusted_hash}` and only grants it through an interactive
"Hooks need review / Trust all and continue" screen, which a headless
session can never answer. Project `trust_level = "trusted"` is **not**
enough — measured: a fully trusted scratch repo with a valid
`.codex/hooks.json` fired nothing until the flag was added.
`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` is Codex's own documented hatch
("Intended only for automation that already vets hook sources"), and this
daemon writes the file itself. It is emitted only alongside
`permission_flag`, so it inherits the isolated-worktree argument in
claude.md rather than widening it: in a linked checkout Codex keeps hook
review and the session simply reports no native subagent telemetry.

The events wired today are `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop`, both of which
carry `session_id`, `turn_id`, `agent_id`, `agent_type`, `cwd`,
`hook_event_name` and `transcript_path` (Stop adds `agent_transcript_path`
and `last_assistant_message`) — enough to pair a child's start with its
stop by `agent_id`. Handlers **must** carry `"type": "command"`; omitting
it makes Codex log `failed to parse hooks config … missing field 'type'`
and silently run no hooks at all.

There is still no prompt-boundary hook, so queued messages reach a Codex
session via nudge (keystrokes into the pane) or transcript-tail fallback;
task completion is unaffected because it is explicit (`aq task close`
through the injected CLI/MCP surface).

**Transcripts are read** (2026-08-27). Codex records sessions under
`~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<iso>-<uuid>.jsonl`, keyed by date
rather than work_dir, so `CodexTranscriptReader`
(`src/sessions/transcripts/codex.py`) resolves a session by reading
`session_meta.payload.cwd` out of each candidate's first line — newest
first, capped at 200 files. Once the watcher has learned the UUID (below)
resolution is a direct filename match and no scan happens.

The rollout records the same conversation twice: `event_msg` is the UI
event stream, `response_item` the model-facing record. The reader takes
text from `event_msg` and tool calls from `response_item`, which are
disjoint — taking both `message` channels double-counts every turn, and
`response_item.message` additionally carries the system-prompt and
`<environment_context>` frames. Token usage comes from
`event_msg/token_count` using `last_token_usage`, never the cumulative
`total_token_usage`.

**`permission_flag` follows the trust argument in claude.md:** it is
emitted only when the session's work_dir is an isolated worktree (or the
profile opts in). In a linked checkout Codex keeps its own sandbox +
approval prompts, and the session is attachable so a human can answer them.
Codex additionally has softer modes (`--full-auto`, `-s workspace-write`)
that could ride `args` if you want sandboxed-but-automatic instead.

**`skip_escape_before_enter: true` is load-bearing** — Escape in the Codex
composer backtracks/clears; a blind Escape-then-Enter sequence would eat
the nudge text.

**The trust screen is painted late, and its rows start with `›`.** Codex's
trust menu renders `› 1. Yes, continue` — the same prefix the readiness poll
looks for — and it can land *after* the first dismissal pass. Startup
therefore refuses readiness on any capture where a rule above matches, and
holds the final pass open for `sessions.dialog_settle_seconds` (default
1.5 s). Verified live on Codex 0.151 (task smart-orbit.7).

**Startup noise is harmless:** an update banner, a bubblewrap PATH warning,
and possible MCP-startup warnings all render above the composer and need no
keys. The `login-required` dialog quarantines instead of typing — an
unauthenticated codex cannot be fixed by keystrokes; run `codex login` on
the host.

**`composer_clear_keys: ["C-u"]`** is the recovery key for a nudge that was
typed but never submitted. Enter races the composer's repaint (an attached
dashboard terminal resizing the pane is the reliable way to lose one), and
text left behind blocks every later nudge on the empty-composer guard — the
stall ladder then stops climbing forever. The provider first re-presses
Enter on a widening backoff; only if that still fails does it clear with
these keys, and only while it can still see its own marker on the input
line. Empty this list to make the provider leave the text alone instead.
