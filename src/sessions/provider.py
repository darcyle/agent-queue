"""Session provider contract — the ABC every session backend implements.

A *session* is one OS-level agent run whose initial process is the harness
CLI (``claude``, ``codex``, …).  Providers create, observe, nudge and kill
those sessions; the daemon never blocks on one.  See
``docs/specs/design/session-runtime.md`` §5.

Three providers are planned:

``tmux``
    The default on Linux/WSL2 — an attachable pane per session.  **Not in
    this module set**: it needs a POSIX host and lands with a later wave.
``subprocess``
    Degraded fallback: detached process group, log file, no pane.  Liveness
    and transcripts still work, so tasks complete normally.
``fake``
    In-memory, scriptable; every reconciler and cascade test runs on it.

Capability gating
-----------------
Callers branch on :class:`Cap`, **never** on ``provider.name``.  A caller
that wants to peek asks ``Cap.PEEK in provider.capabilities`` and degrades
gracefully; calling an unsupported operation raises
:class:`CapabilityUnsupported` rather than returning a plausible lie.

``is_running`` vs ``process_alive``
-----------------------------------
Deliberately distinct.  A tmux pane with ``remain-on-exit on`` outlives its
dead agent, so "the runtime artifact exists" and "the agent process is
alive" are two different facts and the exit classifier needs both.

Unknown is not dead
-------------------
:class:`PartialListError` exists so a provider can say "I could not
enumerate everything" instead of returning a short list that a caller would
read as "the missing ones died".  Reaping on a failed secondary probe was
one of the Gas City post-mortem's most expensive bugs.
