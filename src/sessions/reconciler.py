"""Reconcile desired session state against observed session state.

One ``tick()`` per orchestrator cycle (~5 s), zero LLM calls, deterministic.
The daemon does not *drive* agents — it observes them and converges.

``tick()`` runs six steps in a fixed order, each isolated so a failure in
one does not skip the rest:

1. **Refresh observation** — who is actually alive.
2. **Drain-ack** — the explicit end of the completion protocol.
3. **Exit classifier** — dead process, task still open → typed verdict.
4. **Orphans** — the two ways row and task can disagree: a live session
   whose task is no longer open (kill it), and an open task whose session
   row is not live (release it).
5. **Stall ladder** — alive but silent: nudge → restart → quarantine.
6. **Named desired-state** — converge persistent sessions (start/sleep).
7. **Backstop** — ``stuck_timeout_seconds`` as the final net, not the
   primary defense.

The single most important rule in this module: **unknown is not dead.**  A
``PartialListError`` from a provider, or a failed secondary probe, defers
every destructive action for that prefix.  The classifier acts on positive
evidence of death and on nothing else.

        ``claiming``/``preparing`` while it resolves and boots into a

        """Reconcile the two ways a session row and its task can disagree.

        Design §4.1's table has *"task already closed, session lingering →
        normal drain path (kill, ``stopped``)"*, but nothing implemented it:
        ``Verdict.DRAINED`` is only reachable from inside ``_step_exits``,
        which requires a **dead** process.  There are three ways in with the
        process still alive:

        * ``complete_session_task`` releases the workspace and IDLEs the
          agent at close time, before the ack — so an agent that closes and
          never acks leaves a reassignable worktree with a live agent in it;
        * ``stop_task`` finds no ``_adapters`` entry (the session fork never
          registers one) and no live ``_running_tasks`` entry, so it cancels
          nothing and leaves the session running;
        * ``aq session kill`` before its own fix.

        The mirror case — an open task whose session row is *not* live —
        is handled here too: nothing else would ever free it, because
        ``_step_exits`` and the ladder both iterate live rows only.

        Ordering matters for (a): ``_step_drain_ack`` runs earlier in the
        same tick, so an ack that has landed always wins and the agent gets
        the graceful path.  A terminal task is also a normal, short-lived
        state while a pool close moves from ``complete_session_task`` to
        ``release_claim``.  That interleaving must release only the task
        hold: pool sizing owns any later drain decision and its grace period.
