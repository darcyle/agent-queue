"""Compose a launch: profile + harness + task → :class:`SessionSpec`.

Everything harness-specific happens here so providers stay dumb: a provider
receives an argv, an env, a work_dir and a list of files to write, and knows
nothing about Claude, Codex, prompt modes or hooks.

Three things are easy to get wrong and are therefore explicit:

**Names are derived, and only here.** ``s-<task_id>`` for task sessions,
``n-<profile>[--<project>]`` for named ones, sanitized to
``^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$``.  Other layers address named sessions by their
*logical* name (``supervisor-<project_id>``); mapping logical → provider
name is this module's job alone (design §3).

**The bootstrap prompt is short on purpose.** It says who you are, where you
are, and "run ``aq prime``".  The full prompt renders to
``<work_dir>/.aq/prompt.md`` and comes back through ``aq prime``, so the
launch does not have to squeeze a 40 KB prompt through a command line.

**Prompts over ~1 KB never ride argv.**  tmux's ``new-session`` command
buffer is roughly 2 KB, and a truncated command is a launch that half-works.
Above the harness's ``max_argv_prompt_bytes`` the prompt is written to
``.aq/tmp/`` and the argv becomes a tiny ``sh -c`` wrapper that reads it
back and ``exec``s the harness — the command string stays constant-size
however long the prompt is.
