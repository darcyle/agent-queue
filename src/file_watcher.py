"""Filesystem watcher for hook-driven automation.

Monitors files and directories for changes using mtime polling (same approach
as ConfigWatcher) and emits EventBus events when changes are detected.  This
enables hooks to react to file modifications, new files, and deletions without
requiring OS-specific inotify/FSEvents integration.

Supports two watch types:

- **File watches**: monitor specific files (e.g., ``config.yaml``,
  ``pyproject.toml``).  Emits ``file.changed`` events with the file path,
  operation (modified/created/deleted), and optional diff.

- **Folder watches**: monitor directories (optionally recursive).  Emits
  ``folder.changed`` events with a list of changed files, aggregated over
  a debounce window to avoid event storms from bulk operations (e.g.,
  ``git checkout`` touching many files at once).

Watch rules are stored in the database as JSON in the hook's trigger config::

    {
        "type": "event",
        "event_type": "file.changed",
        "watch": {
            "paths": ["pyproject.toml", "src/config.py"],
            "project_id": "my-project"
        }
    }

    {
        "type": "event",
        "event_type": "folder.changed",
        "watch": {
            "paths": ["src/", "tests/"],
            "recursive": true,
            "extensions": [".py", ".ts"],
            "project_id": "my-project"
        }
    }

Integration:
    The FileWatcher is created by HookEngine at ``initialize()`` and scans
    watches on each ``tick()`` call.  It holds a reference to the EventBus
    for emitting change events.  The orchestrator's existing tick loop
    drives the polling cycle.
