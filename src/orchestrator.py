"""Orchestrator — the central brain of the agent queue system.

Runs a ~5-second loop that drives the entire task lifecycle: promoting
DEFINED tasks whose dependencies are met, scheduling READY tasks onto idle
agents, launching agent execution as background asyncio tasks, managing git
workspaces (clone/link/init), parsing plan files into chained subtasks,
handling PR/approval workflows, and monitoring for stuck tasks.

Design principle: **zero LLM calls for orchestration**.  All scheduling and
state-machine logic is purely deterministic.  Every token budget goes to
actual agent work, not coordination overhead.

Heavy operations (agent execution, git clones) run as background asyncio
tasks so the main loop stays responsive and can continue checking heartbeats,
promoting tasks, and handling approvals while agents work.

Key method call hierarchy (read these to understand the full lifecycle)::

                ├── _discover_and_store_plan()   # Plan discovery + approval flow
                └── cleanup               #   Release workspace + free agent

Workspace locking lifecycle::

    _schedule() assigns task → _prepare_workspace() acquires lock
    → agent runs with exclusive workspace access
    → _complete_workspace() performs git operations
    → cleanup section releases lock via db.release_workspaces_for_task()

    If the task times out, crashes, or is admin-stopped, the lock is
    released in the error/timeout handler so the workspace isn't stuck.

Related modules:

- ``src/scheduler.py`` — Pure-function proportional fair-share scheduler.
  Called by ``_schedule()`` with a ``SchedulerState`` snapshot; returns
  ``AssignAction`` objects with zero side effects.  See that module's
  docstring for the deficit-based algorithm and min-task guarantee.

- ``src/hooks.py`` — Event-driven and periodic hook engine.  Ticked each
  cycle by ``run_one_cycle`` step 7; event hooks fire asynchronously via
  ``EventBus``.  See that module's docstring for the context pipeline,
  short-circuit checks, and LLM invocation with tool access.

- ``src/state_machine.py`` — ``VALID_TASK_TRANSITIONS`` dict defining the
  legal (status, event) → status transitions.  The orchestrator calls
  ``db.transition_task()`` which enforces these transitions.

- ``src/adapters/base.py`` / ``src/adapters/claude.py`` — Agent adapter
  interface (start/wait/stop/is_alive).  The orchestrator delegates all
  LLM interaction to adapters and only processes the resulting
  ``AgentOutput``.

See ``specs/orchestrator.md`` for the full behavioral specification.

    The orchestrator is deliberately decoupled from Discord: it communicates

    This makes it testable in isolation and keeps the transport layer
    pluggable.

    Key internal state:

    * ``_running_tasks`` — maps task_id to a background ``asyncio.Task``
      for each agent execution currently in flight.  The main loop checks
      this dict every cycle to clean up finished work and avoid double-
      launching.

    * ``_adapters`` — maps agent_id to the live adapter instance (e.g.
      ``ClaudeAdapter``) so we can stop or cancel a running agent from
      admin commands like ``stop_task``.

    * ``_paused`` — when True, the scheduler is skipped entirely (no new

        is designed to complete quickly (typically <1s of DB queries and
        state checks) — heavy work (agent execution, git operations) is
        delegated to background asyncio tasks that run concurrently.

        The cycle is organized into three phases with numbered steps:

        **Phase 1 — Promotion cascade** (steps 1-4):

        1. **Approvals** — complete tasks whose PRs were merged so
           their dependents can be promoted in the same cycle.
        2. **Resume paused** — bring back rate-limited/token-exhausted tasks
           whose backoff timers have expired.
        3. **Promote DEFINED** — check dependency satisfaction and move tasks
           to READY.  This must happen after approvals so freshly-completed
           parent tasks unblock their children immediately.
        4. **Stuck monitoring** — rate-limited alerts for DEFINED tasks that
           have been waiting too long (runs after promotion so we don't
           false-alarm on tasks that just got promoted).

        **Phase 2 — Scheduling & launch** (steps 5-6):

        5. **Schedule** — assign READY tasks to idle agents (skipped when
           the orchestrator is paused).
        6. **Launch** — fire off background asyncio tasks for each new
           assignment.  These run concurrently with future cycles.

        **Phase 3 — Housekeeping** (steps 7-10):

        7. **Hook engine tick** — process periodic hooks; event-driven hooks
           fire asynchronously via the EventBus.
        8. **Config hot-reload** — periodically re-read non-critical settings
           from disk (scheduling, archive, monitoring, etc.) without restart.
        9. **Log cleanup** — prune old LLM interaction logs and flush
           prompt analytics for long-term cost analysis.
        10. **Auto-archive** — sweep terminal tasks older than the configured
            threshold into the archive so they no longer clutter active views.

        Ordering invariant: steps 1-3 form a "promotion cascade" where
        completing an approval can immediately unblock a DEFINED task in
        the same cycle.  Breaking this order would add a 5s delay to
        dependency chain progression.

        Error handling: the entire cycle is wrapped in a try/except so
        that a failure in one step (e.g., a DB query error) doesn't crash
        the daemon — it logs the error and retries on the next cycle.

            and catches unexpected exceptions to reset state cleanly.

        Layer 3 (_execute_task): **Business logic** — the actual pipeline:
            workspace setup → agent launch → output streaming → result
            handling → cleanup.

        completion.  It runs as an ``asyncio.Task`` concurrently with the main
        loop, so multiple tasks can execute in parallel (one per agent).

        Steps:
        1. **Assign** — mark task IN_PROGRESS and agent BUSY in the DB.
        2. **Workspace setup** — clone/link/init the repo, create or switch
           to the task branch (see ``_prepare_workspace``).  If no workspace
           is available, the task is returned to READY for retry next cycle.
        3. **Agent context assembly** — build a structured markdown prompt
           containing: system metadata (workspace, project, branch), execution
           rules (subtask vs. root behavior, commit/rebase instructions),
           upstream dependency results (for chain continuity), optional agent
           profile role instructions, and the task description itself.  This
           prompt is what the agent "sees" as its assignment.
        4. **Memory recall** — if the memory subsystem is enabled, inject
           semantically relevant historical context (past task results,
           project notes) into the agent's context.  Non-fatal on failure.
        5. **Agent launch** — create an adapter (e.g. ClaudeAdapter), pass
           the assembled ``TaskContext``, and start the agent process.
        6. **Stream + wait** — forward agent output messages to the Discord
           thread in real time.  Detect ``AskUserQuestion`` tool use in the
           stream and send dedicated rich notifications.  If the agent hits
           a rate limit, an exponential-backoff retry loop re-initializes
           and retries (up to ``rate_limit_max_retries``) before giving up.
        7. **Token accounting** — record tokens used, check budget warnings.
        8. **Result handling** — branch on the ``AgentResult`` enum:
           - COMPLETED: run ``_complete_workspace`` (commit/merge/PR), then
             ``_discover_and_store_plan`` to detect plan files for approval,
             then save to memory for future task context.
           - FAILED: increment retry count; if exhausted, mark BLOCKED and
             notify about orphaned downstream tasks.
           - PAUSED (rate limit or tokens): set a ``resume_after`` timestamp
             so the task is automatically retried after the backoff.
           - WAITING_INPUT: transition to WAITING_INPUT and send a question
             notification with interactive response buttons.
        9. **Cleanup** — release workspace lock, free agent (IDLE or PAUSED
           if admin-paused mid-execution), remove adapter reference.

        #      task's completion) checks workspace availability before
        #      assigning new work.  Releasing before freeing the agent
        #      ensures the workspace count is accurate when the scheduler
        #      next evaluates this project.
        #   2. Free agent SECOND — transitions the agent from BUSY back to
        #      IDLE (or PAUSED if an admin paused it mid-execution).
        #   3. Remove adapter reference — allows garbage collection of the
        #      adapter process handle.
