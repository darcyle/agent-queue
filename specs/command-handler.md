# CommandHandler Specification

## 1. Overview

`CommandHandler` is the unified execution layer for all operational commands in AgentQueue. It is the single code path through which every operation must pass — both Discord slash commands and the LLM chat agent tools delegate their business logic here. Presentation and formatting are handled by the callers; this layer concerns itself only with execution and returning structured results.

The handler holds a reference to an `Orchestrator` instance (which provides database access and git operations) and an `AppConfig`. It also maintains a small amount of conversational state: an optional `_active_project_id` (the currently focused project), and an optional `_on_project_deleted` callback that external layers (e.g. the Discord bot) can register to react to project deletions.

The `db` property is a convenience accessor that returns `self.orchestrator.db`.

## 2. Architecture

### Command Dispatch

All commands are executed through a single public method:

```python
async def execute(self, name: str, args: dict) -> dict
```

Internally, `execute` looks up a method named `_cmd_{name}` on the instance using `getattr`. If found, the method is called with `args` and its return value is returned. If no such method exists, `{"error": "Unknown command: {name}"}` is returned. Any unhandled exception raised inside a command method is caught and returned as `{"error": str(e)}`.

### Command Registration

Commands are registered implicitly: any instance method named `_cmd_<command_name>` becomes a callable command. There is no explicit registry or decorator. Adding a new command means defining a new `_cmd_` method.

### Constructor Signature

```python
CommandHandler(orchestrator: Orchestrator, config: AppConfig)
```

After construction, callers may set `handler._on_project_deleted = callback` to register a post-deletion hook (signature: `callback(project_id: str) -> None`).

---

## 3. Return Format

Every command returns a `dict`. The conventions are:

- **Success:** A dict containing the relevant data. The exact keys vary by command. No `"success"` key is used explicitly; the absence of an `"error"` key signals success.
- **Error:** A dict with a single key `"error"` whose value is a human-readable string describing what went wrong.

Examples:
```python
{"created": "my-project", "name": "My Project", "workspace": "/path/to/workspace"}
{"error": "Project 'foo' not found"}
```

Some commands include both a primary result and an optional `"warning"` key when a non-fatal concern exists (e.g. IN_PROGRESS tasks during a destructive git operation).

---

## 4. Command Categories

### Status

---

#### `get_status`

Returns a system-wide snapshot of the orchestrator state.

**Parameters:** None.

**Behavior:** Queries all projects, agents, and tasks. For each agent that has a current task, the task's title, project, and status are included. Tasks are filtered into `in_progress` and `ready_to_work` lists.

**Returns on success:**
```python
{
    "projects": <int: total project count>,
    "agents": [
        {

- `archive_channels` (optional, default `False`): Passed through to the caller in the response so the Discord layer can act on it. This handler does not archive channels itself.

**Behavior:** Checks whether any tasks are currently IN_PROGRESS and refuses deletion if so. Captures the project's Discord channel ID before deletion. After the database cascade completes, calls `_on_project_deleted(project_id)` if the callback is registered.

**Returns on success:**
```python
{
    "deleted": <str: project_id>,
    "name": <str>,
    "channel_ids": {"channel": <str>},   # present only if a channel was linked

**Parameters:**
- `project_id` (required; also accepted as `project_name`)
- `channel_name` (required): The Discord channel name (leading `#` is stripped).
- `_resolved_channel_id` (optional): If the caller (e.g. Discord slash command layer) has already resolved the channel ID, it may pass it here to skip the name-lookup step.
- `guild_channels` (optional): A list of `{"id": <str/int>, "name": <str>}` dicts representing all text channels in the guild. Required if `_resolved_channel_id` is not provided.

**Behavior:** Strips `#` from `channel_name`. Uses `_resolved_channel_id` if present; otherwise iterates `guild_channels` looking for a name match. If no match is found, returns an error. On success, delegates to `_cmd_set_project_channel`.

**Returns on success (match found):**
```python
{
    "channel_id": <str>,
    "project_id": <str>,
    "project_name": <str>,
}
```

**Returns on success:**
```python
{
    "project_id": <str>,
    "repo_id": <str>,
    "branch": <str>,
    "status": "pushed",
}
```

**Errors:**

---

#### `merge_branch`

Merges a branch into the repository's default branch.

**Parameters:**
- `project_id` (required)
- `branch_name` (required)
- `repo_id` (optional)

**Behavior:** Uses `repo.default_branch` if available, otherwise `"main"`. Calls `_warn_if_in_progress` regardless of merge outcome.

**Returns on success (merged):**
```python
{
    "project_id": <str>,
    "repo_id": <str>,
    "branch": <str>,
    "target": <str: default_branch>,
    "status": "merged",
    "warning": <str>,  # present only if IN_PROGRESS tasks exist
}
```

**Returns on success (conflict):**
```python
{
    "project_id": <str>,
    "repo_id": <str>,
    "branch": <str>,
    "target": <str>,
    "status": "conflict",
    "message": "Merge conflict — merge was aborted",

---

### Git Status Command

---

#### `get_git_status`

Reports git status across all repos for a project, or falls back to the project workspace if no repos are configured.

**Parameters:**
- `project_id` (required)

**Behavior:** For each repo, determines the checkout path (LINK uses `source_path`; CLONE uses `checkout_base_path`). Validates the path exists and is a git repo. Calls `git.get_current_branch`, `git.get_status`, and `git.get_recent_commits(count=5)`. Does not use `_resolve_repo_path`; performs its own path resolution across all repos in the project.

**Returns on success:**
```python
{
    "project_id": <str>,
    "project_name": <str>,
    "repos": [
        {
            "repo_id": <str>,
            "path": <str>,
            "branch": <str>,
            "status": <str: status output or "(clean)">,
            "recent_commits": <str>,
        },
        ...
    ],
}
```

Per-repo errors are embedded as `{"repo_id": <str>, "error": <str>}` entries rather than aborting the whole command.

**Errors:**
- Project not found.
- Project has no repos and no valid workspace path.
- Project workspace is not a git repository.

---

### Workspace Maintenance Commands

These commands operate across all workspaces for a project and are intended for the chat agent to diagnose and fix workspace issues. All git operations use `asyncio.to_thread(subprocess.run, ...)` or `git._arun()` to avoid blocking the event loop.

---

#### `find_merge_conflict_workspaces`

Scans all workspaces for a project to detect branches with merge conflicts against the default branch without modifying any working tree.

**Parameters:**
- `project_id` (optional): Falls back to `_active_project_id`.

**Behavior:** For each workspace, fetches from origin, then iterates all remote branches. For each branch (excluding the default branch, HEAD, and `dependabot/*`), runs `git merge-base` to find the common ancestor, then `git merge-tree` to simulate a three-way merge. If the merge-tree output contains conflict markers (`+<<<<<<< `), the branch is flagged as conflicting. Also checks for active working tree conflicts via `git status --porcelain` (looking for `UU`, `AA`, `DD` status codes).

All git operations are run via `asyncio.to_thread(subprocess.run, ...)` since they are one-off diagnostic commands not covered by `GitManager` methods.

**Returns on success:**
```python
{
    "project_id": <str>,
    "workspaces_scanned": <int>,
    "workspaces_with_conflicts": <int>,
    "conflicts": [
        {
            "workspace_id": <str>,
            "workspace_name": <str>,
            "workspace_path": <str>,
            "current_branch": <str>,
            "locked_by_task_id": <str | None>,
            "locked_by_agent_id": <str | None>,
            "has_working_tree_conflict": <bool>,
            "branch_conflicts": [
                {
                    "branch": <str>,
                    "task_id": <str>,
                    "conflicting_files": [<str>, ...],
                    "commits_behind_main": <str>,
                },
                ...
            ],
        },
        ...
    ],
}
```

**Errors:**
- `project_id` not provided and no active project set.
- Project not found.
- No workspaces found for the project.

---

#### `sync_workspaces`

Synchronizes all workspaces for a project to the latest main branch.

**Parameters:**
- `project_id` (optional): Falls back to `_active_project_id`.
- `skip_locked` (optional, default `True`): Skip workspaces locked by an agent.

**Behavior:** Delegates to `_sync_single_workspace` for each workspace. Uses a mix of `git._arun()` for standard git operations and `asyncio.to_thread(subprocess.run, ...)` for status checks.

Per-workspace sync logic:
1. Validates the workspace is a valid git repo directory.
2. Skips workspaces locked by an agent (unless `skip_locked=False`).
3. Fetches latest from origin via `git._arun(["fetch", "origin", "--prune"])`.
4. Gets current branch via `git.aget_current_branch()`.
5. Checks for uncommitted changes and active merge conflicts via `git status --porcelain`.
6. **If on the default branch:** stashes uncommitted changes if present, then hard-resets to `origin/<default_branch>`.
7. **If on a feature branch:**
   - Auto-commits uncommitted changes via `git.acommit_all()`.
   - Pushes the branch to origin via `git.apush_branch(force_with_lease=True)`.
   - Updates the local default branch reference (in worktrees, uses `git update-ref`; in normal repos, checks out default, hard-resets, then returns to the feature branch).
   - Attempts to rebase the feature branch onto `origin/<default_branch>`. If rebase conflicts, aborts and leaves the branch as-is.

**Returns on success:**
```python
{
    "project_id": <str>,
    "default_branch": <str>,
    "total_workspaces": <int>,
    "synced": <int>,
    "skipped": <int>,
    "errors": <int>,
    "workspaces": [<per-workspace result dicts>, ...],
}
```

Per-workspace result dicts include `workspace_id`, `workspace_name`, `workspace_path`, `status` (`"synced"`, `"skipped"`, `"conflict"`, or `"error"`), and additional fields depending on the action taken.

**Errors:**
- `project_id` not provided and no active project set.
- Project not found.
- No workspaces found for the project.

---

    "title": <str>,
    "status": "created" | "updated",
}
```

**Errors:**
- Project not found.
- Title produces an empty slug after slugification.

---

#### `delete_note`

    "content": <str: full file content>,
    "title": <str>,
    "path": <str: absolute file path>,
    "size_bytes": <int>,
}
```

**Errors:**

**Parameters:**
- `project_id` (required)
- `title` (required): Note title. Slugified for the filename.
- `content` (required): Content to append.

**Behavior:** Resolves the file path as `{workspace}/notes/{slugify(title)}.md`. If the file exists, appends `\n\n` followed by the new content. If the file does not exist, creates it with `# {title}\n\n{content}`. Creates the `notes/` directory if it does not exist.

**Returns on success:**
```python
{
    "path": <str: absolute file path>,
    "title": <str>,
    "status": "appended" | "created",
    "size_bytes": <int>,
}
```

**Errors:**
- Project not found.

#### `compare_specs_notes`

Lists specs and notes files for gap analysis. Returns raw file listings — no LLM call is made.

**Parameters:**
- `project_id` (required)
- `specs_path` (optional): Override for the specs directory path. If not provided, the command checks for a `specs/` directory in the project's repo first, then falls back to `{workspace}/specs/`.

```

**Errors:** None expected (unrecognized action falls through to the `status` case).

---

#### `restart_daemon`

Runs `git pull --ff-only` followed by `pip install -e .` to pick up dependency changes. Both commands are run in a thread via `asyncio.to_thread(subprocess.run, ...)` to avoid blocking the event loop. On success, logs a notification and triggers a restart via `SIGTERM`.

**Parameters:**
- `reason` (optional, default `"No reason provided"`): Human-readable reason for the update.

**Returns on success:**
```python
{"status": "updating", "message": "Update pulled and daemon restart initiated", "pull_output": <str>, "reason": <str>}

**Parameters:**
- `path` (required): File path. If not absolute, it is joined with `config.workspace_dir`.
- `max_lines` (optional, default `200`): Maximum lines to return. If the file is longer, a truncation notice is appended.

**Behavior:** Resolves the path and validates it via `_validate_path`. Reads up to `max_lines` lines. Returns an error for binary files (UnicodeDecodeError).

**Returns on success:**
```python
{"content": <str: file contents>, "path": <str: validated absolute path>}
```

**Errors:**
- Path is outside allowed directories.
- File not found.
- Binary file (cannot display).

#### `run_command`

Executes a shell command in a validated working directory. Intended for the chat agent.

**Parameters:**
- `command` (required): Shell command string (executed via `shell=True`).
- `working_dir` (required): Directory to run the command in. If not an absolute path, the handler first tries to look it up as a project ID; if that fails, it joins with `config.workspace_dir`.
- `timeout` (optional, default `30`, max `120`): Execution timeout in seconds.

**Behavior:** Validates the working directory via `_validate_path`. Runs the command in a thread via `asyncio.to_thread(subprocess.run, command, shell=True, ...)` to avoid blocking the event loop. Stdout is truncated to 4000 characters; stderr to 2000 characters.

**Returns on success:**
```python
{
    "returncode": <int>,
    "stdout": <str>,
    "stderr": <str>,
}
```

**Errors:**
- Working directory is outside allowed directories.
- Directory not found.
- Command timed out.

---

#### `search_files`

Searches for patterns in files within a validated directory. Intended for the chat agent.

**Parameters:**
- `pattern` (required): Search pattern (regex for `grep` mode; glob for `find` mode).
- `path` (required): Directory to search. If not absolute, joined with `config.workspace_dir`.
- `mode` (optional, default `"grep"`): Either `"grep"` (recursive regex search, up to 50 matches) or `"find"` (filename glob search).

**Behavior:** Validates the directory via `_validate_path`. Runs the search command in a thread via `asyncio.to_thread(subprocess.run, ...)`. In `grep` mode: `grep -rn --include=* -m 50 <pattern> <path>`. In `find` mode: `find <path> -name <pattern> -type f`. Output is truncated to 4000 characters.

**Returns on success:**
```python
{"results": <str: output or "(no matches)">, "mode": <str>}
```

**Errors:**
- Path is outside allowed directories.
- Directory not found.
- Search timed out.

---

#### `list_directory`

Lists files and directories at a given path within a project workspace. Used by both the chat agent and the `/browse` Discord command.

**Parameters:**
- `project_id` (optional if active project is set): Project whose workspace to browse.
- `workspace` (optional): Workspace name or ID. If omitted, the first workspace for the project is used. Looked up by name first, then by ID.
- `path` (optional, default `""`): Relative path within the workspace to list. Empty string lists the workspace root.

**Behavior:** Resolves the workspace path to an absolute path via `os.path.realpath()` to prevent CWD-relative resolution issues (e.g., if a workspace path was stored as a relative path, it could otherwise resolve relative to the bot's working directory). Joins the relative `path` with the workspace root, validates it via `_validate_path`, then lists the directory contents. Entries are sorted alphabetically and separated into directories and files (with sizes).

**Returns on success:**
```python
{
    "project_id": <str>,
    "path": <str: relative path or "/">,
    "workspace_path": <str: resolved absolute workspace root>,
    "workspace_name": <str>,
    "directories": [<str>, ...],
    "files": [{"name": <str>, "size": <int>}, ...],
}
```

**Errors:**
- `project_id` is required (no active project set).
- Workspace not found for project.
- Project has no workspaces.
- Access denied: path is outside allowed directories.
- Directory not found.
- Permission denied.

## 5. Path Validation (`_validate_path`)

```python
async def _validate_path(self, path: str) -> str | None
```

This method is a security gate that ensures file operations cannot escape designated directories.

**Logic:**
1. Resolves the given path to its canonical realpath (resolves symlinks).
2. Resolves `config.workspace_dir` to its canonical realpath.
3. If the resolved path is within (starts with `{workspace_real}/`) or equal to `workspace_real`, the canonical path is returned (allowed).
4. Otherwise, fetches all repos from the database. For each repo that has a `source_path`, resolves that `source_path` to its canonical realpath. If the given path is within or equal to any repo's `source_path`, the canonical path is returned (allowed).
5. If none of the above match, returns `None` (denied).

The caller is responsible for checking whether `None` was returned and returning an access-denied error to the user.

## 6. Repo Path Resolution (`_resolve_repo_path`)

```python
async def _resolve_repo_path(self, args: dict) -> tuple[str | None, RepoConfig | None, dict | None]
```

Returns a 3-tuple: `(checkout_path, repo_config, error_dict)`. On success, `error_dict` is `None`. On failure, `checkout_path` is `None`.

**Logic:**

1. Reads `project_id` and `repo_id` from `args`.
2. If neither is provided, returns an error.
3. If `project_id` is provided, fetches and validates the project exists. `repo_id` alone (without `project_id`) is also a valid input — the repo is looked up directly, which keeps older repo-id-only commands working.
4. **Repo resolution:**
   - If `repo_id` is provided, fetches that specific repo (error if not found).
   - If only `project_id` is provided, fetches the project's repos and takes the first one (or `None` if none exist).
5. **Path determination:**
   - If a repo was found:
     - `LINK` source type: uses `repo.source_path`.
     - `CLONE` or `INIT` source type: uses `repo.checkout_base_path`.
     - If neither path is set: error.
   - If no repo was found: returns an error telling the user to add workspaces via `/add-workspace`.
6. Validates that the determined path exists as a directory (error if not).
7. Calls `git.validate_checkout(checkout_path)` to confirm it is a git repository (error if not).
8. Returns `(checkout_path, repo, None)`.

**Summary of error conditions:**
- Neither `project_id` nor `repo_id` provided.
- Project not found.
- Repo not found (when `repo_id` specified).
- Repo has no usable path configured.
- No repo found and no project context.
- Project has no repos and no valid workspace.
- Path does not exist on disk.
- Path is not a valid git repository.

## 7. In-Progress Warning (`_warn_if_in_progress`)

```python
async def _warn_if_in_progress(self, project_id: str) -> str | None
```

Queries the database for any tasks with status `IN_PROGRESS` for the given project. If any are found, returns a warning string of the form:

```
⚠️ {n} task(s) currently IN_PROGRESS for this project — this operation may disrupt running agent(s).
```

If no tasks are in progress, returns `None`.

This method is called by the high-level git commands `checkout_branch`, `commit_changes`, and `merge_branch` after a successful git operation. The warning is included in the response dict under the `"warning"` key when present. It is never a blocking error — the git operation proceeds regardless.
