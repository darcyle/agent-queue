# Discord Integration Specification

## 1. Overview

Discord is the exclusive control plane for Agent Queue. There are no other user-facing interfaces — all commands, status queries, and notifications flow through Discord. The integration has three distinct layers:

- **Bot Core** (`src/discord/bot.py`) — `AgentQueueBot`, a `discord.ext.commands.Bot` subclass. Owns channel routing, message history, authorization, and thread management.
- **Slash Commands** (`src/discord/commands.py`) — All interactive commands registered on the application command tree. Thin wrappers that delegate business logic to the shared `CommandHandler`.
- **Notification Formatters** (`src/discord/notifications.py`) — Pure functions that produce structured Discord message text for task lifecycle events.

The bot uses `discord.Intents.default()` plus `message_content`. The command prefix `!` is registered but unused; all interaction happens through slash commands and @-mentions.

## 2. Bot Core (`AgentQueueBot`)

### 2.1 Initialization

`AgentQueueBot.__init__` receives `AppConfig` and `Orchestrator`. It constructs a `ChatAgent` (the LLM interface) and wires the `_on_project_deleted` callback from the command handler to `self.clear_project_channels`, so that any caller that deletes a project (not just Discord commands) automatically clears the bot's in-memory channel caches.

Key instance state initialized at construction:

| Attribute | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `_channel` | `discord.TextChannel \| None` | Global fallback channel (name from `config.discord.channels["channel"]`, default `"agent-queue"`) |
| `_project_channels` | `dict[str, TextChannel]` | Forward mapping: `project_id -> channel` |
| `_channel_to_project` | `dict[int, str]` | Reverse mapping: `channel_id -> project_id` (O(1) lookup) |
| `_processed_messages` | `set[int]` | Deduplication guard for `on_message` |
| `_channel_summaries` | `dict[int, tuple[int, str]]` | History compaction cache: `channel_id -> (last_message_id, summary_text)` |
| `_channel_locks` | `dict[int, asyncio.Lock]` | Per-channel mutex for LLM calls |
| `_notes_threads` | `dict[int, str]` | Maps thread IDs to project IDs for the notes subsystem |
| `_boot_time` | `float \| None` | UTC timestamp recorded on `on_ready`, used to discard pre-boot messages |
| `_restart_requested` | `bool` | Set by `/restart` command |
| `_guild` | `discord.Guild \| None` | Cached guild reference |
| `_note_viewers` | `dict[int, dict[str, int]]` | Maps thread_id → {note_filename: message_id} for auto-refresh |
| `_notes_toc_messages` | `dict[int, int]` | Maps thread_id → TOC message_id for view persistence |
| `_note_refresh_timers` | `dict[str, asyncio.TimerHandle]` | Debounce timers for note refresh (keyed by `project_id:filename`) |

The `_notes_threads` mapping is persisted to disk at `<database_dir>/notes_threads.json` as a JSON object with two keys: `threads` (thread_id → project_id) and `toc_messages` (thread_id → toc_message_id). Loaded at startup and saved on every modification. Keys are stored as strings in JSON and converted back to `int` on load. Legacy format (flat dict without `threads`/`toc_messages` keys) is supported for backward compatibility.

### 2.2 `setup_hook`

`setup_hook` runs before the bot connects and performs two actions:

1. Calls `setup_commands(self)` to register all slash commands on the application command tree.
2. Installs a global authorization guard (`_auth_interaction_check`) on `self.tree.interaction_check`. This guard runs before every slash command interaction. Unauthorized users receive an ephemeral `"You don't have permission to use this command."` response and the command is dropped. The guard falls through to the original `interaction_check` if the user is authorized.

If `guild_id` is configured, commands are copied to the guild and synced immediately so they appear without the standard propagation delay.

### 2.3 `on_ready`

`on_ready` performs startup tasks:

1. Records `_boot_time` as the current UTC timestamp.
2. Resolves the global channel by scanning `guild.text_channels` for the configured name. If not found, a warning is logged.
3. Calls `_resolve_project_channels()` to populate the per-project channel cache from the database.
4. Registers orchestrator callbacks (`set_notify_callback` and `set_create_thread_callback`) if any usable channel exists — either the global channel or at least one per-project channel. This allows projects with dedicated channels to receive notifications and task threads even when no global channel is configured.
5. Initializes the `ChatAgent` LLM client, logging whether credentials were found.
6. Calls `_reattach_notes_views()` to restore persistent `NotesView` button handlers on existing TOC messages from `_notes_toc_messages`.

### 2.4 Authorization

Authorization is enforced at two levels:

**Slash commands** — The `_auth_interaction_check` hook on `self.tree.interaction_check` runs before every interaction. Unauthorized users receive an ephemeral rejection and the command is not executed.

**Messages** — `on_message` silently ignores messages from unauthorized users (no response, no log).

The check itself (`_is_authorized`) reads `config.discord.authorized_users` (a list of user ID strings). If the list is empty, all users are permitted. Otherwise, `str(user_id)` must appear in the list.

### 2.5 Channel Management

#### Per-project channels

Each project can have a dedicated `discord.TextChannel`. The bot maintains two synchronized mappings:

- `_project_channels[project_id]` — the channel object for fast notification routing.
- `_channel_to_project[channel_id]` — the reverse, used by `on_message` and command resolution helpers to identify which project a message belongs to.

#### `_resolve_project_channels()`

Called at startup. Iterates all projects from the database. For each project with a `discord_channel_id`:
- If the channel exists in the guild, it is added to both caches with a log message.
- If the channel no longer exists (deleted from Discord), the stale ID is cleared from the database (`db.update_project(project_id, discord_channel_id=None)`) and a warning is logged. This prevents orphaned references from accumulating.

#### `update_project_channel(project_id, channel)`

Called immediately after `/set-channel` or `/create-channel` so routing takes effect without a restart. Removes the stale reverse-mapping entry for any previously cached channel before adding the new one.

#### `clear_project_channels(project_id)`

Called after project deletion (via the `_on_project_deleted` callback). Removes:
- `_project_channels[project_id]`
- `_channel_to_project` entry for the old channel
- All `_notes_threads` entries mapping to the deleted project (persisted to disk)
- `_channel_summaries` and `_channel_locks` entries for all affected channel/thread IDs

#### `get_project_for_channel(channel_id)`

O(1) lookup against `_channel_to_project`. Returns `project_id` or `None`.

### 2.6 Message Routing

`_get_channel(project_id)` returns the dedicated project channel if one is cached, otherwise falls back to the global `_channel`. If no channel is available, it returns `None`.

When a message is routed to the **global channel** for a project that has no dedicated channel, the message text is prefixed with a `` [`project-id`]  `` tag so users can identify the source project. This applies to both plain messages (`_send_message`) and thread-root messages (`_create_task_thread`).

`_is_global_channel(channel, project_id)` — returns `True` if `channel` is the global fallback and `project_id` has no dedicated channel.

### 2.7 `on_message` — Message Routing and Context

`on_message` responds to messages from users in the following situations:

| Condition | Responds |
|---|---|
| Message in the global bot channel | Yes |
| Message in a per-project channel | Yes |
| Bot is @-mentioned anywhere | Yes |
| Message in a registered notes thread | Yes |
| Any other channel, not mentioned | No (silent) |

Filtering sequence:
1. Ignore own messages.
2. Ignore unauthorized users (silent).
3. Dedup: skip if `message.id` is in `_processed_messages`. The set is trimmed to 100 entries when it exceeds 200.
4. Skip messages created before `_boot_time` (prevents reprocessing history after restart).
5. Determine channel context (global, per-project, mentioned, or notes thread).
6. Strip the bot mention (`<@{user_id}>`) from the message text.
7. Reply with a prompt if text is empty.

For per-project channels (when not the global bot channel), a context prefix is prepended to the user message before passing it to the LLM:
```
[Context: this is the channel for project `{project_id}`. Default to using project_id='{project_id}' for all project-scoped commands.]
{user_text}
```

For notes threads (when not the global bot channel), a rich NOTES MODE context is injected:
```
[NOTES MODE for project '{notes_project_id}'. BEHAVIOR: The user will type stream-of-consciousness thoughts. 1. Call list_notes to see existing notes. 2. Categorize input — decide which note it belongs to or create new. 3. Use append_note to add to existing, or write_note for new. 4. Respond with BRIEF confirmation: which note updated + 1-line summary. 5. For browsing/management/comparison requests, use appropriate tools. Default project_id='{notes_project_id}'.]
{user_text}
```

LLM calls are serialized per channel using `_channel_locks` to prevent duplicate concurrent responses. If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not configured, the bot responds with a fixed message directing the user to slash commands only.

On `AuthenticationError`, credentials are reloaded via `agent.reload_credentials()` and the chat call is retried once before returning an error message.

### 2.8 Message History

`_build_message_history(channel, before)` fetches up to `MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES = 50` messages from the channel history (oldest-first after reversing). It converts them to the LLM message format:

- Bot messages → `{"role": "assistant", "content": msg.content}`
- Other messages → `{"role": "user", "content": "[from {display_name}]: {msg.content}"}`

Consecutive messages with the same role are merged (Anthropic API requirement).

### 2.9 History Compaction

Constants:
- `MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES = 50` — maximum messages fetched from Discord
- `COMPACT_THRESHOLD = 20` — if more than this many messages exist, compact the older portion
- `RECENT_KEEP = 14` — number of recent messages preserved verbatim after compaction

When history length exceeds `COMPACT_THRESHOLD`, messages are split into two groups:
- **older** — all messages except the last `RECENT_KEEP`
- **recent** — the last `RECENT_KEEP` messages, kept verbatim

The older group is summarized via `_get_or_create_summary()`. The summary is injected as a synthetic user message:
```
[CONVERSATION SUMMARY — earlier messages]
{summary}
```
followed by a synthetic assistant acknowledgement `"Understood, I have the conversation context."` so the message list maintains proper role alternation.

`_get_or_create_summary(channel_id, older_messages)`:
- Returns `None` if the message list is empty or the LLM is not ready.
- Checks `_channel_summaries[channel_id]`: if the cached `(last_message_id, summary)` covers the same messages (`cached[0] >= last_id`), returns the cached summary.
- Otherwise builds a transcript (`"{author}: {content}"` per line) and calls `agent.summarize(transcript)`, caching the result.

### 2.10 Thread Creation

`_create_task_thread(thread_name, initial_message, project_id)` creates a Discord thread for streaming agent output. It:

1. Resolves the target channel (project-specific or global).
2. If routing to the global channel, prepends `[{project_id}]` to the displayed thread name.
3. Sends a thread-root message `"**Agent working:** {display_name}"` in the channel.
4. Creates a thread on that message (name capped at 100 chars).
5. Sends `initial_message` inside the thread.
6. Returns a tuple of two async callbacks:
   - `send_to_thread(text)` — sends content into the thread using `_send_long_message`. Logs but does not raise on errors.
   - `notify_main_channel(text)` — replies to the thread-root message, visually linking the notification to the thread in the channel feed. Falls back to a plain `channel.send` if the reply fails.
7. Returns `None` if no channel is available.

### 2.11 Long Message Handling

`_send_long_message(channel, text, *, reply_to, filename)`:
- `len(text) <= 2000`: sent as-is (with `reply_to` if provided).
- `2000 < len(text) <= 6000`: split at line boundaries into ≤2000-char chunks. First chunk respects `reply_to`. Lines exceeding 2000 chars are hard-split.
- `len(text) > 6000`: a preview (first paragraph or first 300 chars) is sent with the full content attached as a file (`filename`, default `"response.md"`).

### 2.12 Orchestrator Callbacks

The orchestrator receives two callbacks wired in `on_ready`:

- `notify_callback` → `_send_message(text, project_id)` — sends a plain text message to the project's channel (or the global channel with a project tag).
- `create_thread_callback` → `_create_task_thread(thread_name, initial_message, project_id)` — creates a streaming thread and returns the `(send_to_thread, notify_main_channel)` callback pair.

---

## 3. Slash Commands

All slash commands are registered in `setup_commands(bot)` inside `src/discord/commands.py`. Every command delegates its business logic to `bot.agent.handler` (the shared `CommandHandler`). Commands are thin formatting wrappers; they handle Discord-specific concerns (embeds, file uploads, deferral, ephemeral responses) but contain no business logic themselves.

### Channel-to-project resolution

A helper function `_resolve_project_from_context(interaction, project_id)` is used by all project-scoped commands that accept an optional `project_id`. If the user supplies a `project_id`, it is used unchanged. If not, the interaction's channel is looked up in `bot._channel_to_project`. This means commands run inside a project channel automatically target that project without requiring explicit parameter input.

When resolution fails and the command requires a project, an ephemeral error is returned: `"Could not determine project — please provide project_id or run this command from a project channel."`

### In-progress task warnings

Several destructive git commands may return a `warning` key in the result dict when IN_PROGRESS tasks exist in the target project. The `_with_warning(msg, result)` helper appends this warning to the success message.

### Status emojis and colors

All task statuses have associated emoji and hex color values used in embeds and the `TaskReportView`:

| Status | Emoji | Hex Color |
|---|---|---|
| DEFINED | ⚪ | #95a5a6 |
| READY | 🔵 | #3498db |
| ASSIGNED | 📋 | #9b59b6 |
| IN_PROGRESS | 🟡 | #f39c12 |
| WAITING_INPUT | 💬 | #1abc9c |
| PAUSED | ⏸️ | #7f8c8d |
| VERIFYING | 🔍 | #2980b9 |
| AWAITING_APPROVAL | ⏳ | #e67e22 |

### 3.7 Git Operations

There are two families of git commands. The **project-oriented** commands auto-detect the project from channel context and resolve the first associated repo by default. The **repo-oriented** commands take an explicit `repo_id` and operate directly on that repository.

Most git commands that may take more than 3 seconds use `await interaction.response.defer()` before executing. Exceptions: `/git-log` responds directly without deferring; `/git-diff` only defers when the diff exceeds 1800 chars.

#### Project-oriented commands (auto-detect from channel)

### 3.9 Notes Commands

#### `/notes`
Opens an interactive notes browser for a project with button-based navigation.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `project_id` | str (optional) | Project (auto-detected from channel) |

**Behavior:**
1. Fetches notes via `list_notes` command
2. Sends a `NotesView` — an interactive table-of-contents message with buttons per note file
3. Creates a Discord thread on that message named `"Notes: {project_name}"` (`auto_archive_duration=1440`)
4. Sends a welcome message in the thread explaining stream-of-consciousness input
5. Registers the thread with `bot.register_notes_thread(thread_id, project_id)`
6. Stores the TOC message ID in `_notes_toc_messages` for view persistence

**`NotesView`** (module-level class in `commands.py`, `timeout=None`):
- Rows 1–4: Up to 20 note buttons (`ButtonStyle.secondary`), one per note file, label is note title (truncated to 72 chars)
- Row 5: Control buttons — `Refresh`, `Close Thread`, plus `◀ Prev`/`Next ▶` when notes > 20
- All buttons use `custom_id` for persistence across bot restarts
- Custom ID scheme: `notes:{project_id}:view:{note_slug}`, `notes:{project_id}:refresh`, `notes:{project_id}:close`, `notes:{project_id}:page:{direction}`

**Note button callback:** Reads note content via `read_note`, sends as a message in the thread with a `NoteContentView` (Dismiss button). Deletes any previous view of the same note first. Tracks in `_note_viewers[thread_id][filename] = message_id`.

**`NoteContentView`**: Single `Dismiss` button (`ButtonStyle.danger`). On click: deletes the message and removes from `_note_viewers`. Custom ID: `notes:{project_id}:dismiss:{note_slug}`.

**Refresh button:** Re-fetches notes and edits the TOC message with updated content and buttons.

**Close button:** Archives the thread, removes from `_notes_threads` and `_notes_toc_messages`, cleans up `_note_viewers`.

**Auto-refresh:** When a note is written or appended (via `on_note_written` callback from CommandHandler), any active viewer of that note in any notes thread for the project is automatically refreshed — the old viewing message is deleted and replaced with updated content. A 2-second debounce prevents Discord rate limiting.

**View persistence:** On bot startup (`on_ready`), `_reattach_notes_views()` iterates `_notes_toc_messages`, fetches current notes for each project, creates fresh `NotesView` instances, and calls `bot.add_view(view, message_id=toc_msg_id)` to reattach button handlers.

#### `/write-note`
Creates or updates a project note.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | str | Note title |
| `content` | str | Note content (markdown) |
| `project_id` | str (optional) | Project (auto-detected from channel) |

#### `/delete-note`
Deletes a project note by title.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | str | Note title |
| `project_id` | str (optional) | Project (auto-detected from channel) |

---

### 3.10 System / Admin Commands

#### `/orchestrator`
Pauses, resumes, or queries the orchestrator's scheduling state.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `action` | choice | `pause`, `resume`, or `status` |

Status response shows current state (PAUSED or RUNNING) and number of running tasks.

#### `/restart`
Signals the daemon to restart. Sets `bot._restart_requested = True` and calls `handler.execute("restart_daemon", {})`.

No parameters.

---

### 3.11 UI Components — `TaskReportView`

`/tasks` renders an interactive `discord.ui.View` with collapsible status sections.

#### `TaskReportView`

A `discord.ui.View` with `timeout=600` (10 minutes).

**State:**
- `tasks_by_status` — dict mapping status string to list of task dicts
- `total` — total task count
- `expanded` — set of currently expanded status names

**Initial expansion:** Active and actionable statuses are expanded by default — `IN_PROGRESS`, `ASSIGNED`, `READY`, `FAILED`, `BLOCKED`, `PAUSED`, `WAITING_INPUT`, `AWAITING_APPROVAL`. If none of those have tasks, the first non-empty status in `_STATUS_ORDER` is expanded.

Status display order: `IN_PROGRESS`, `ASSIGNED`, `READY`, `DEFINED`, `PAUSED`, `WAITING_INPUT`, `AWAITING_APPROVAL`, `VERIFYING`, `FAILED`, `BLOCKED`, `COMPLETED`.

#### `StatusToggleButton`

One button per status that has tasks. Clicking toggles that status between expanded and collapsed. Expanded sections use `ButtonStyle.primary`; collapsed use `ButtonStyle.secondary`. The label is `"{Status Display Name} ({count})"` with the status emoji.

#### `TaskDetailSelect`

A dropdown populated with tasks from all currently expanded sections, capped at 25 options (Discord's select menu limit). Each option shows the task title (truncated to 95 chars) as the label and the task ID as the description. Selecting a task fetches and displays full task details as an ephemeral followup via `_format_task_detail`.

#### Content rendering

Expanded sections show: a `### {emoji} {Display} ({count})` header, then each task as `**{title}** \`{id}\``, capped at `_MAX_TASKS_PER_SECTION = 15` tasks. A `"...and N more"` line is appended if the section is larger.

Collapsed sections show a single line: `{emoji} **{Display}** ({count})`.

If the rendered content exceeds 1950 chars, it re-renders with a tighter cap of 8 tasks per expanded section.

## 4. Notification Formats

All notification formatters are pure functions in `src/discord/notifications.py`. They return plain text strings (no embeds). They are called by the orchestrator and consumed by the `notify_callback`, which routes them to the appropriate channel.

### 4.1 Error Classification

`classify_error(error_message)` maps error messages to `(label, suggestion)` pairs by keyword matching on the lowercased error string. The first matching pattern wins.

| Keyword | Label | Suggestion |
|---|---|---|
| `"error_max_structured_output_retries"` | Structured-output failure | Simplify the task description or remove JSON-schema constraints. |
| `"auth"` or `"authentication"` | Authentication error | Check that ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or claude login) is valid and not expired. |
| `"rate_limit"`, `"rate limit"`, or `"429"` | Rate-limit | The API rate limit was hit. The task will be retried automatically. |
| `"quota"` | Token quota exhausted | Daily or session token quota exceeded. Wait for quota reset or increase limits. |
| `"token"` | Token limit | The context window or token budget was exceeded. Break the task into smaller pieces. |
| `"timeout"` | Timeout | The agent exceeded the stuck-timeout. Increase stuck_timeout_seconds or simplify the task. |
| `"config"` | Configuration error | A config value is invalid. Check model name, allowed_tools, and MCP server settings. |
| `"mcp"` | MCP server error | An MCP server failed. Verify MCP server configs in the task context. |
| `"permission"` | Permission denied | The agent couldn't access a file or directory. Check workspace permissions. |
| `"cancelled"` | Cancelled | The task was stopped manually. |
| (no match) | Unexpected error | Check daemon logs (`~/.agent-queue/daemon.log`) for full details. |
| (empty/None message) | Unknown error | Check daemon logs for details. |

### 4.2 Notification Types

#### `format_task_completed(task, agent, output)`

Emitted when a task finishes successfully.

```
**Task Completed:** `{task.id}` — {task.title}
Project: `{task.project_id}` | Agent: {agent.name}
Tokens used: {output.tokens_used:,}
Summary: {output.summary}           [only if summary present]
Files changed: {file1}, {file2}, …  [only if files_changed present]
```

#### `format_task_failed(task, agent, output)`

Emitted when a task fails (before exhausting retries).

```
**Task Failed:** `{task.id}` — {task.title}
Project: `{task.project_id}` | Agent: {agent.name} | Retry: {retry_count}/{max_retries}
Error type: **{error_type_label}**
```
{error_message[:300]}…
```
💡 {fix_suggestion}
_Use `/agent-error {task.id}` for the full error log._
```

The error message is truncated to 300 chars with `…` (unicode ellipsis) appended if longer.

#### `format_task_blocked(task, last_error)`

Emitted when a task exhausts its retry limit and enters BLOCKED state.

```
**Task Blocked:** `{task.id}` — {task.title}
Project: `{task.project_id}` | Max retries ({max_retries}) exhausted. Manual intervention required.
Last error type: **{error_type_label}**  [only if last_error present]
💡 {fix_suggestion}                      [only if last_error present]
_Use `/agent-error {task.id}` to inspect the last error._
```

#### `format_pr_created(task, pr_url)`

Emitted when an agent creates a GitHub pull request and the task moves to AWAITING_APPROVAL.

```
**PR Created:** `{task.id}` — {task.title}

#### `format_chain_stuck(blocked_task, stuck_tasks)`

Emitted when a blocked task has downstream dependents that are now permanently stuck.

```
⛓️ **Dependency Chain Stuck:** `{blocked_task.id}` — {blocked_task.title} is BLOCKED
Project: `{blocked_task.project_id}` | {N} downstream task(s) are now permanently stuck:
  • `{id}` — {title} (status: {status})
  …                                         [up to 10 tasks; then "… and N more"]
_Use `/skip-task {blocked_task.id}` to skip the blocked task and unblock the chain, or `/restart-task {blocked_task.id}` to retry it._
```

#### `format_stuck_defined_task(task, blocking_deps, stuck_hours)`

Emitted by the orchestrator's stuck-task monitor when a DEFINED task has not been promoted to READY for an extended period.

```
⏳ **Stuck Task:** `{task.id}` — {task.title}
Project: `{task.project_id}` | Has been DEFINED for **{stuck_hours:.1f} hours** without promotion to READY.
Blocked by:
  • `{dep_id}` — {dep_title} (status: {dep_status})
  …                                         [up to 5 deps; then "… and N more"]
_Use `/skip-task <blocking-task-id>` to skip a blocker, or `/restart-task <blocking-task-id>` to retry it._
```

If no unmet dependencies are found, the blocking section is replaced with: `_No unmet dependencies found — this may be a bug in promotion logic._`

#### `format_budget_warning(project_name, usage, limit)`

Emitted when a project's token usage crosses a warning threshold.

```
**Budget Warning:** Project **{project_name}** at {pct:.0f}% ({usage:,} / {limit:,} tokens)
```

`pct` is `usage / limit * 100`. If `limit` is zero, `pct` is reported as 0.
